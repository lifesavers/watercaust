***Be cautious. This needs Major Work, Major Moral Snapshot Revisions under True Herstorical and Historical Rush.ed⁺ Constraints, and Remodeling of those Constraints for Disastrous Water-borne Split Times characteristic of the Whole Range of Nature's Remands, including Megathrust Subduction Events, Global Heat Induced Hurricanes and Storm Surges, and more. Eventually, the Author hopes this Work will surface a variety⁵ of media and mechanisms that haven't been tried before and carry lasting value.***

## Practiced Emergency⁵ Response ##
### Evacuation Orders ###
Time is intensely important, and may be best thought of in Media in terms of interruptible half-minute, 30s planned block units, incorporating time for the Souls touched by Media to not just attend to the media, but also get themselves, in their indivieduality⁵, thru their OODAs to safety⁵. In some GROUNDSTRIKE scenarios, like Banda Aceh on 004-12月24日, there was less than 15 minutes, only 12-14 of which, perhaps, were reliable to use from our present, better practiced and monitored "GROUNDSTRIKE" Alert Models. There was a very limited amount of time to run, OODA for an available BUILDING DIVE, DIVE, and SECURE THE PORTHOLE. Trading the BUILDING DIVE for more distance could be deadly, and even hesitating for 10s-20s on the "BUILDING DIVE v ADDED MINUTE RUN" trade can be, in a case like this, a fatalistic strategy⁵, versus the Programmatic Media Stack Optimization wei can complete off prior and local building knowledge, ideally with faithful "sample materials" and "building strength quality⁵" reports and tests that Citizens can hold Governments accountable for completing an accurate model of BEFORE a disaster. It leads to remarkably different "Bull's Eyes" for BUILDING DIVES and BUILDING DIVE Practices, particularly in Cities along shorelines, like Los Angelas or Shanghai 上海. 

Being caught outdoors could The Waves, which went as far inland as 5 kilometers, and carried oft-deadly detritus (wood and metal shards, blunt force building materials) entrailed, had to be avoided at all costs. 

"EVACUATE SHORE, EVACUATE CITY⁵, YOU HAVE 2, 4, 4, 6, 8, 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE WAVE!!! RUN AWAY FROM SHORE!!" (i18n), with the repeat number preventing planning fallacy⁵, signifying the STOP SECURING, MUST GO and the last number the GROUNDSTRIKE, allowing 6 minutes of RUN in a specified vector "AWAY FROM SHORE", with BUILDING DIVE introduced as an Elementary Operation repeated as the 6, 8, and GROUNDSTRIKE events approach, with Building Owners away from Shore n-couraged, in the meantime, to post up sheets of paper with a Simple "Bull's Eye" Target drawn for the BUILDING DIVE.
